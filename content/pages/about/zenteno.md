      I started my professional career in 2015 as a Teaching Assitant at the
      Mechanical Engineering department of my university. I was involved in
      performing my social and engineering abilities, such as mentorship, public
      speaking, mechanical design and programming to develop or improve the
      tools students and professors used for their classes. Then I founded a
      (very) small company on robotics and automation that closed in 2018, but
      then the idea evolved to [zDynamics](https://zdynamics.org/): the first
      educational group of advanced robotics in Mexico; at the same time, I was
      a software employee in some some other companies (but I do not consider
      myself as a *software developer*). Nowadays, I have developed new skills
      and improved the already existing ones :)
